================================================================================

The kvm API is a set of ioctls that are issued to control various aspects
of a virtual machine.  The ioctls belong to three classes:

System ioctls
   These query and set global attributes which affect the
   whole kvm subsystem.  In addition a system ioctl is used to create
   virtual machines.

VM ioctls
   These query and set attributes that affect an entire virtual
   machine, for example memory layout.  In addition a VM ioctl is used to
   create virtual cpus (vcpus) and devices.

   VM ioctls must be issued from the same process (address space) that was
   used to create the VM.

vcpu ioctls
   These query and set attributes that control the operation
   of a single virtual cpu.

   vcpu ioctls should be issued from the same thread that was used to create
   the vcpu, except for asynchronous vcpu ioctl that are marked as such in
   the documentation.  Otherwise, the first ioctl after switching threads
   could see a performance impact.

device ioctls
   These query and set attributes that control the operation
   of a single device.

   device ioctls must be issued from the same process (address space) that
   was used to create the VM.
